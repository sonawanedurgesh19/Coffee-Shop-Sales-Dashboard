# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard
Project Title:
Coffee Shop Sales & Performance Dashboard

Short Summary:
This interactive Excel dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales, customer footfall, and operational performance for a multi-location coffee shop chain. It visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends across different times, locations, and product categories. The dashboard is designed to empower management with actionable insights to optimize staffing, manage inventory, and drive sales growth.

Problem Statement:
The coffee shop management lacked a centralized and dynamic tool to monitor and understand its business performance. Key business questions regarding peak hours, top-performing products, store-level profitability, and customer purchasing habits were difficult to answer quickly. This absence of accessible data made it challenging to make informed, proactive decisions for operations, marketing, and inventory management.

Goal of the Dashboard:
⦁	To consolidate and visualize key business metrics like sales, footfall, and average transaction value.
⦁	To identify daily and hourly patterns in customer traffic and sales volume.
⦁	To analyze the sales performance of different product categories, sizes, and individual items.
⦁	To compare the performance of various store locations to identify top performers and areas for improvement.
⦁	To provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for stakeholders to explore data and derive actionable insights.

Steps Taken:
1.	Data Aggregation & Cleaning: Collected and consolidated sales transaction, footfall, and product data from the first half of the year (January to June).
2.	Data Modeling: Used Excel's PivotTables to structure and summarize the raw data, creating the necessary calculations for analysis.
3.	KPI Development: Calculated and defined core KPIs: Total Sales, Total Footfall, Average Bill per Person, and Average Order per Person.
4.	Visualization: Created a series of charts (line, pie, bar) to represent the data from different perspectives.
5.	Dashboard Construction: Assembled all KPIs and visuals onto a single sheet, organizing them for a logical flow and clear narrative.
6.	Interactivity: Implemented Slicers for "Month Name" and "Day Name" to allow users to dynamically filter the entire dashboard and drill down into specific time periods.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals:
⦁	Top-Line KPIs: Four cards at the top display the overall performance for the selected period: Total Sales ($6.98M), Total Footfall (149,116), Avg Bill/Person ($4.69), and Avg Order/Person (1.44).
⦁	Quantity Ordered Based on Hours: A line chart illustrating the flow of orders throughout the day, clearly showing a major peak between 9 AM and 11 AM and a smaller afternoon rise.
⦁	Categories % Distribution Based on Sales: A pie chart breaking down revenue by category. It highlights that Coffee (39%) and Bakery (28%) are the two primary revenue drivers.
⦁	% Size Distribution Based on Orders: A pie chart showing that customer orders are almost evenly split between Small (31%), Regular (30%), and Large (30%).
⦁	Footfall and Sales over various Store Locations: A bar chart comparing the three stores. Hell's Kitchen emerges as the top-performing location in both footfall (50,735) and sales (_2.36M).
⦁	Top 5 Products Based on Sales: A bar chart ranking the most profitable products, with Barista Espresso leading significantly.
⦁	Order on Weekdays: A combination chart showing that while footfall varies slightly, sales revenue remains remarkably consistent across all seven days of the week.

Key Insights:
1.	Peak Performance Window: The business is heavily dependent on the morning rush between 9 AM and 11 AM. This is the most critical period for staffing and service speed.
2.	Core Product Strategy: Coffee and Bakery items constitute 67% of total sales, indicating they are the core of the business and should be the focus of marketing and quality control.
3.	Store Performance Hierarchy: Hell's Kitchen is the flagship store and could serve as a model for operations at the other two locations, which have similar but lower performance.
4.	Weekday Reliability: The consistent sales across weekdays suggest a strong base of regular, commuting customers. Weekend footfall is slightly lower, presenting a potential area for growth through promotions.
5.	Top Sellers: Core brewed drinks (Espresso, Tea, Chai) are the most popular items, suggesting a customer preference for classic, high-quality beverages over more niche products.

Business Impact:
⦁	Optimized Staffing: Management can use the hourly trends data to create more efficient staff schedules, ensuring adequate coverage during the morning peak and avoiding overstaffing during quieter periods.
⦁	Improved Inventory Management: Insights into top-selling products and categories allow for better stock control, reducing waste on unpopular items and preventing stockouts of key sellers like espresso and bakery goods.
⦁	Targeted Marketing & Promotions: The dashboard identifies opportunities for growth, such as launching weekend-specific promotions to boost footfall or creating combo deals featuring the top product categories (Coffee & Bakery).
⦁	Data-Driven Decision-Making: Provides a single source of truth for performance tracking, empowering store managers and leadership to make strategic decisions based on real-time data rather than intuition.
